    Hello, I'm XIAOJUESHI, a developer passionate about front-end technology.
    I'm dedicated to sharing front-end development experiences, best practices,
    and solutions, hoping to help more developers grow.
  </p>

  <p>
    I specialize in JavaScript, CSS, and modern front-end frameworks,
    particularly React, TypeScript, and Astro. I believe elegant code and good
    user experience are the foundation of building excellent websites.
  </p>

  <p>
    This blog is where I record my learning insights, technical explorations,
    and development experiences. I regularly share problems encountered in
    front-end development and their solutions, as well as my thoughts on the
    evolution of front-end technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides programming, I enjoy reading, traveling, and photography. I believe
    maintaining a wide range of interests helps expand thinking and inspire
    creativity, which is also beneficial for technical work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope the content here is helpful to
    you. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me
    through social media.
